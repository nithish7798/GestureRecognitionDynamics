This project uses the UCF50 action recognition video dataset. out of the 50 activities, I have used 6 activities related to the gym: BenchPress, JumpRope, PullUps, PushUps, JumpingJack, and Lunges.
This project uses a fusion of the Mediapipe pose estimator with hybrid deep neural network models to detect gym activities.
